# PSE NE 2024 – 1º Seminário em Engenharia de Sistemas em Processos no Nordeste

This repository contains all materials related to the work I presented at the **1º Seminário em Engenharia de Sistemas em Processos do Nordeste (PSE NE 2024)**, an academic and technical event focused on advancements in Process System Engineering. The event was held in 2024 in the city of Campina Grande, in the state of Paraíba, Brazil.

Please note that some parts of the code, such as comments and image generation functions, are written in Portuguese, as the visual outputs and documentation were tailored for a Portuguese-speaking audience.

## 📁 Folder Structure

This project organizes its components into distinct folders, with each containing a markdown file that provides detailed guidance when necessary.

### 📂 `Arduino/`

This folder contains the code that runs on the Arduino UNO microcontroller. It handles serial communication with TankSim and implements the PIRNN in C++.

### 📂 `LaTeX/`

> ⚠️ **Note:** All materials in this folder are written in **Portuguese**, as the event took place in Brazil.

This folder contains the LaTeX source files for the presentation slides and the technical article.

The article was made, but it was **not published**, as the seminar focused solely on oral presentations without formal proceedings.

### 📂 `PyTorch/`

This folder contains the code used to create and train the PIRNN using the PyTorch library.

### 📂 `TankSim/`

This folder contains the code for the TankSim software, developed in Python using the Qt framework. It simulates the tank system and communicates with the Arduino via serial connection.
