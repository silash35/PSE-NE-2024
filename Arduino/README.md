# Arduino Code

This directory contains the code that runs on the Arduino microcontroller. It includes the C++ implementation of the PIRNN.

## How to Run

The code has been tested on **Arduino UNO** and **Arduino Nano**, but it should work on other compatible boards. To upload the code to your board, follow these steps:

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code).
1. Open this directory in VS Code.
1. Make sure all recommended extensions in `.vscode/extensions.json` are installed.
1. Connect your Arduino to your computer via USB.
1. Compile and upload the code to the board using PlatformIO.

If you're familiar with Arduino, you are not obligated to use VS Code. You can upload the code using your preferred IDE or method.

For more details on using PlatformIO, refer to the [PlatformIO website](https://platformio.org/) and the [PlatformIO documentation](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/).

## How to Modify the Code

To edit the code, we recommend using VS Code with the project's recommended extensions.

Before making modifications, read the PlatformIO documentation and familiarize yourself with the project files. This will help prevent compilation errors and ensure the system runs correctly.
